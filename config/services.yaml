# This file is the entry point to configure your own services and load the default configuration.
# If you want to remove a service, deprecate it, or change its class, you can apply the changes here.
#
# If you are *not* using the default services.yaml file in your package, you *must* pass an
# absolute path to this file's location to the `imports` key in your package's services.yaml (e.g.
# imports: ['%kernel.project_dir%/config/services.yaml'])
#
# See https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html
#
# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed
